This is a a very minimalistic website to practice basic HTML and CSS skills learned in the Odin Project. It is objectively a very ugly site and that's okay. It's purpose is to practice setting up GitHub repositories, familiarizing myself with Git, and practicing the various basic HTML elements and CSS properties. Displayed in this site are just the basic boilerplate HTML format, titles, paragraphs, links, and images.
