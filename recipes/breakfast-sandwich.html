        <h3>How to make it!</h3>
        <p>This breakfast sandwich is loaded with eggs, ham and cheese and is hugged by a warm English muffin that toasts in the same pan. Serve as is or with hot sauce if you like a fiery breakfast!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 english muffin, cut in half</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2-4 slices of ham, we love black forest but any kind will do</li>
            <li>1/3 cup finely shredded cheese, we used Mexican cheese</li>
            <li>1 tsp chives, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil or butter to saute</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and drizzle with 1 Tbsp oil.</li>
            <li>Place your Engish muffin on half of the pan cut-side down. Crack 2 eggs side by side on the other half of the pan and break the yolks with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Once eggs are mostly cooked through, sprinkle tops with salt and pepper to taste, 1 tsp fresh chives and half of shredded cheese. Place toasted english muffins cut-side-down over the eggs and lightly press on the tops with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Flip the sandwich over (egg-side-up). Place ham over half of your sandwich and top with more cheese. Fold the sandwich together and and remove from heat.</li>
        </ol>
